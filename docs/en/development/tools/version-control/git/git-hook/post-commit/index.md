pre-commit, a feature of `git hook`, is a tool available on PyPl to set up commands and scripts to be run automatically before committing in a Git repository. This tool is used to maintain code quality and ensure consistency.

See official documentation for details.<br />
[https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/)

With pre-commit, developers can run a variety of static analysis and code formatting tools prior to commit. Pre-commit allows developers to set customizable hooks (hooks) for the entire repository or for individual files.

The pre-commit configuration is described in a file named.`pre-commit-config.yaml`. This file specifies settings such as hooks to use, commands to execute, files to exclude, etc. pre-commit automatically executes hooks before commit and decides whether to accept or abort the commit based on the results of the hooks.

pre-commit is supported by a variety of programming languages and tools, and many existing hooks are publicly available. Custom hooks can also be created.

The main advantages of pre-commit are:

- Improved code quality: pre-commit can be used to improve code quality by unifying code styles and detecting common error patterns.
- Automated static analysis: pre-commit automatically runs static analysis and code formatting tools, eliminating the need for developers to run these tools manually.
- Team adherence to common rules: pre-commit settings are shared within the repository, making it easier for the entire development team to adhere to consistent coding rules and best practices.
- Early detection of errors: pre-commit runs hooks before committing, allowing for early detection and correction of errors and problems.

As a precaution, pre-commit is executed before commit, so commits may be delayed if hooks are executed over time. Also, pre-commit settings are included in the repository, and you must ensure that all team members are using the same settings.

pre-commit is a widely used tool for quality control and development efficiency and has been adopted by many projects.

## Usage

### Hooks used in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

#### Reference article (Japanese): [pre-commitでコミット時にコードの整形やチェックを行う](https://zenn.dev/yiskw713/articles/3c3b4022f3e3f22d276d)

- pre-commit-hooks: A collection of plug-ins provided as part of the pre-commit tool.
  - trailing-whitespace: Detects the presence of unwanted whitespace characters at the end of a file.
  - end-of-file-fixer: Make the last line of the file a newline code.
  - mixed-line-ending: Unify line feed code to LF.
  - check-added-large-files: Prohibit commit of large files.
  - check-yaml: Check the validity of the syntax of YAML files.
  - check-toml: Check the validity of the syntax of TOML files.
  - detect-aws-credentials: Check if there is an AWS credential file. By adding the --allow-missing-credentials option, the hook will pass even if there is no credentail file.
- formatter
  - black: Automatic formatting of Python code to unify code styles.
  - isort: Organize and sort Python import statements.
  - mdformat: Enforce consistent styles in Markdown files.
- linter
  - flake8: Perform static analysis of Python code to detect code style violations and common error patterns.
  - mypy: Static Type Inspection Tool
- Poetry related
  - poetry-check: Call the poetry check command to make sure that the poetry setting is not committed in a broken state.
  - poetry-lock: Call the poetry lock command to ensure that the lock file is up-to-date when committing changes.
  - poetry-export: Call the `poetry export` command to synchronize the `requirements.txt` file with the current dependencies. `dev-dependencies` can also be exported by adding `--dev` to the args.

### hook processing

#### pre-commit hook for individual mdformat[^1]

```bash
git add your_file.md # Stage the target Markdown file
poetry run pre-commit run mdformat
```

#### To run hooks on unstaged files, too.[^1]

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run mdformat --all-files # run with id
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files # Run all id's
```

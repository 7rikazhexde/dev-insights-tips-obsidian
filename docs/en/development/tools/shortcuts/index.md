!!! Quote "What is a shortcut (quoted from the official page)"

    Shortcuts are features that allow you to quickly complete one or more tasks in an app. Shortcuts apps allow you to create your own shortcuts that combine multiple steps. For example, you can build a "Surf Time" shortcut that captures ocean wave information, checks the time required to get to the beach, and plays a surf music playlist.

## What Is AppleScript?

!!! info "Reference: [AppleScript Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html)"
    - AppleScript is a scripting language created by Apple.
    - It allows users to directly control scriptable Macintosh applications, as well as parts of macOS itself.
    - You can create scripts—sets of written instructions—to automate repetitive tasks, combine features from multiple scriptable applications, and create complex workflows.

## References(Japanese)

- [Apple Scripting](http://tonbi.jp/AppleScript/)

  This is a page about automating various things and having fun with Apple's Mac OS X. There are also articles on Automator and JavaScript for Automation (JXA), so reading the articles will give you a better understanding of scripting. You will have a better understanding of how to create scripts by reading the articles.

- [AppleScriptの穴](http://piyocast.com/as/about-this-blog)

  A Blog by Takaaki Naganoya of Piyomaru Software that introduces how to write AppleScript in a practical way. ([Twitter(X)](https://twitter.com/Piyomaruhttps://twitter.com/Piyomaru))
  Anyway, many examples are described. It is a very useful article in Japanese, and I have received some replies on Twitter(X) before.

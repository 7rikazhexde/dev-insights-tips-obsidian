## Usage

### For local

If you want to launch website in a local repository, do the following.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7rikazhexde/dev-insights-tips-obsidian.git
```

> üö® **Note:**<br />
> **This project assumes that you have installed Poetry.**\

```bash
poetry install
```

> üö® **Note:**<br />
> **When using the pip command, please create a virtual environment in the [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv#pyenv-virtualenv) environment and retrieve the package.**
> **The pip command should also retrieve packages for development (requirements-dev.txt).**

```bash
pyenv virtualenv [version] [virtual environment name]
pyenv local [virtual environment name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:**<br />
> **Install pre-commit if you want to run static analysis before committing.**\
> **For pre-commit installation, [check the official website](https://pre-commit.com/)**

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:**<br />
> **When I set [pre-commit-hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-configyaml---hooks) and checked the operation, I confirmed that the files under the site folder were modified multiple times.**
> **Considering the commit process, I determined that there was no need to include files under the site folder in the hook process.**
> **Therefore, I decided to add a Python script that excludes files under the generated site folder and set them to be excluded.**
>
> **The following script can be executed to include them in the [exclude](https://pre-commit.com/#config-exclude) list.**

```bash
poetry run python ci/set_pre-commit-hooks_exclude.py
```
